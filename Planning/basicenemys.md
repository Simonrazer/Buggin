# Basic Enemys/Traps
Just things you can find that spawn randomly in the dark

## General Damadge Dealings
- Projectile
Kinda slow spheres that dont change their path, to be dodged
- Spike ground
Area is marked a secon before spikes come up from under it, dealing damadge if the player didnt move
- Missile
Like Projectile, but it steers towards the player (not good tho)
- Air Strike
Marks the Player for 2 seconds, then locks onto that position (bigger area), and then shoots rockets from above at it
- Laser
Works like air strike, tho it comes directly from the enemy, the lock on timer is shorter. Knocks back.
- Basic stab
When a small enemy comes near you he can do a small damadge. No knockback
- Bonk
Bigger enemys can bonk the Player, more damadge, knockback in the anti-direction of the knocker

## Static
- Directonal Trap
Has some Spike Ground around it
Can only be attack from one direction (~60°), that area is spiked

- Omni Trap
Fires Projectile in all directions (~45° apart)
Optional: Waves of spike ground go up around it

- Firehose
Shoots a stream of projectiles at the player. Firerate varies with area
Optional: Additional Streams at a ~30° Offset

- Circler
Rotates around a fixed point (like it is attached with a tether), Player takes damadge on contact with it or while standing inside its circle
Optional: in the circle is a Firehose

- Bigger thing
Center construct shoots a periodic Air Strike, around it are 2/4 Firehoses

## Dynamic
- Lame boi
Just spawns and runs at the player once he sees him. Maybe different speeds/dmdgs/attackspeeds in different areas

- Sniperino
Keeps distance to the player and shoots a fast projectile

- Charger
Bigger, comes near the player, then charges at him. Knocks back. When not charging can bonk.

- Laserman
Walks in a line in a distance to the player, the line being perpendicular the the dir to the player.
Shoots a lasersometimes.
